## Dumping

[GitTools](https://github.com/internetwache/GitTools) downloads Git repository of the web application.  
To dump the repository, execute the following commands.

```bash
wget https://github.com/internetwache/GitTools/blob/master/Dumper/gitdumper.sh
chmod +x gitdumper.sh
./gitdumper.sh https://example.com/.git/ ./example
```

We should get the git repository in local.  
Then extract the entire project by executing the following.

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/internetwache/GitTools/master/Extractor/extractor.sh
chmod +x extractor.sh
./extractor.sh ./example ./new_example
```

Now we retrieve the entire git project from website.  
It is stored in **“./new_example”** folder.  
We can investigate the repository as follow.

```bash
cd new_example
git log --stat
git checkout <older_commit_id>
```
