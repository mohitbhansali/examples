## Decrypt

### PKCS#12

First of all, you need to format the PKCS file to make the John to recognize it.

```sh
pfx2john example.pfx > hash.txt
```

Crack the password using the formatted text.

```sh
john --wordlist=wordlist.txt hash.txt
```

### PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256

PBKDF2 is part of PKCS#5 v2.0. The format is as follows:

```txt
sha256:<iteration>:<base64-salt>:<base64-password-hash>

# ex.
sha256:10000:ayZoqdmIewDpUB:Ud6aAhvpw9RqZPt/0Rd0U9uPDKLOWKnYHAS+Lm07oqDWwDLw/U74P0jXQ0nsGW9O/jc=
```

To create the hash based on this, run the following commands.

```sh
echo 'sha256:10000:'$(echo '<salt-string>' | base64 | cut -c 1-14)':'$(echo 'password-string' | base64) > hash.txt
```

Now crack the hash using Hashcat.

```sh
hashcat -m 10900 wordlist.txt hash.txt
```
