## Accounts in Social Media & Other Platforms

The target person may use some social media. So first check if the account exists in each platform.

- **Facebook**
- **Instagram**
- **Reddit**
- **Twitter**
- **YoutTube**

Also he/she may use other platforms as follow.

- **GitHub**

<br />

## Google Dorking

Assume the target person named John Smith.

```bash
<social_media> john smith
<social_media> jsmith
```

<br />

## IOSINT (Image OSINT) for Account Pictures

If the person sets the picture as user profile or posts, we can investigate the information about the image using IOSINT.

<br />

## Older Account Pages

Using WayBackMachine, we can gather older information about the target person in each platform.

In WayBackMachine, search the following URLs.

```bash
# Reddit
http://old.reddit.com/user/<username>
https://www.reddit.com/user/<username>

# Twitter
https://twitter.com/<username>
```
