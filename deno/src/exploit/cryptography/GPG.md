## Decrypt

### 1. Crack Passphrase from Private Key

- **gpg2john**

    First of all, you need to format the private key to make the John to recognize it.

    ```sh
    gpg2john private.key > key.txt
    gpg2john private_key.asc > key.txt
    gpg2john private_key.sig > key.txt
    ```

    Crack the passphrase using the formatted text.

    ```sh
    john --wordlist=wordlist.txt key.txt
    ```

- **custom script**

    If you cannot crack the passphrase using gpg2john for some reasons (error, etc), you can use [the script](https://github.com/felip091837/gpg-crack/blob/master/crackgpg.sh) as alternative.

    ```sh
    ./crackgpg.sh example.gpg passwords.txt
    ```

### 2. Import the Private Key

```sh
gpg --import private.key
gpg --import private_key.asc
gpg --import private_key.sig
```

To list the imported keys,

```sh
gpg --list-keys
gpg --list-secret-keys
```

### 3. Decrypt GPG (PGP) using the Passphrase

At that time, you'll be asked for the passphrase, so enter the passphrase you gotten in the previous section.

```sh
# -d: decrypt
gpg -d example.gpg
gpg -d example.pgp
```

<br />

## Decrypt ASC File

We can decrypt **`.asc`** file by importing private key.

```bash
gpg --import private.key
gpg --decrypt example.asc
```

<br />

## Encrypt

```sh
# -e: encrypt
gpg -e example.txt

# -c: encrypt only with symmetric cipher
gpg -c example.txt

# --cipher-algo: Encryption type
gpg --cipher-algo AES-256 -c example.txt
```
