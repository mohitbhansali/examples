## Bypass ALLOWED_HOSTS

If you get the error **â€œInvalid HTTP_HOST header: 'x.x.x.x:8000'. You may need to add 'x.x.x.x' to ALLOWED_HOSTS"** when accessing the website written in Django, you need to intercept the value of the Host in the HTTP request header.  
Then you should be able to access the website.

```bash
Host: 0.0.0.0:8000
# or
Host: 127.0.0.1:8000
```

Or if you can have access to the website, add the new IP address to the **ALLOWED_HOSTS** in the settings.py.

```bash
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['0.0.0.0', '127.0.0.1', 'x.x.x.x']
```
